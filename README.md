# command-line-chess

This is a chess game you can play in the terminal. It's a small python project which I started for 1GAM Galway and will be working on casually in my spare time.
Tested using gnome-terminal on Linux (Arch & Ubuntu).

Lot's of work still left to do before it's playable. So far it's only 2 player hotseat and only the Pawn pieces are someway coded!

Usage:
Download it from github and, in your terminal, run `python app.py` in the project folder. It uses python 3, so use whatever way you normall run python 3 scripts.

Future goals would be:
1. Make a full game of chess possible with basic movesets.
2. Expanded movesets (some or all of those wierd little moves available in chess)
3. To integrate an open source AI chess engine as an include/dependancy.

Your (constructive) feedback is quite welcome!
