# command-line-chess

This is a chess game you can play in the terminal. It's a small python project which I started for 1GAM Galway and will be working on casually in my spare time.
Tested using gnome-terminal on Linux (Arch & Ubuntu).

Lot's of work still left to do before it's playable. So far it's only 2 player hotseat and only the Pawn pieces are someway coded!

### Usage:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to a folder you want to store your game in.
2. Download it from github.
3. Move into the project directory.
4. Give executable permissions to app.py with `chmod +x ./command-line-chess/app.py`
4. Run app.pyin the project folder and enjoy.
 
Here are the commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darrenkearney/command-line-chess
cd command-line-chess
chmod +x ./app.py
./app.py
```
Future goals would be:
- [x] 1. Make a full game of chess possible with basic movesets (and a bit of trust from the player!)
- [ ] 2. Enforce all standard chess rules.
- [ ] 3. To integrate an open source AI chess engine as an include/dependancy.

Your (constructive) feedback is quite welcome!
